- numpy.amax
- numpy.mean
- numpy.median
- numpy.std

And here a link talking about how to print out the value of variables:

- Using % and .format for great good!

About the pipeline to build your model, here are some useful links to know better the classes and functions:

- Cross-validation: evaluating estimator performance
- sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV
- sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor
- sklearn.metrics.r2_score
- sklearn.metrics.make_scorer
